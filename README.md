# Blind mode

This mod format and reads text of cards; menus and buttons, giving support to almost all mechanics in-game.

To download this mod you can use [this powershell script](example.com) that you can run to auto-install the mod. (If the script doesnt find the game's directory, it will ask you to provide one)

If its your first time running the game with this mod, the mod will automatically extract some dependencies and then restart the game, so just wait like 2 seconds.
